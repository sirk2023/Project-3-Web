                    <p class= "p-index margin-control">Computers, MFPs (Photocopiers), CCTV & Phone systems are just some of
                        the devices that contain a hard drive. These hard drives can contain sensitive
                        data that could end up in the wrong hands. While deleting, formatting or
                        overwriting can be considered, physical destruction is the only completely
                        failsafe method to ensure data can never be retrieved. Kill My Data provide
                        the most secure service available for this process.

                    <p class= "p-index margin-control">The team in Kill My Data come from an IT background and have a full
                        understanding of the challenges involved in securely disposing of large
                        volumes of hard drives. These experiences have given us a unique insight
                        into what a destruction service needs to provide for our clients – security,
                        trust and peace of mind. Kill My Data also hold all relevant ISO and industry
                        standard certifications.

                    <p class= "p-index margin-control">Members of our Garda vetted team collect the units from your premises at a
                        pre-arranged date and time. Each unit’s serial number is captured via
                        barcode scanning before being placed in a secure container, locked with
                        tamperproof seals, and transported to our shredding facility. When received
                        at our secure shredding facility, the units are again scanned to cross
                        reference the serial numbers before shredding to 20mm particles. The
                        entire shredding process is video captured for the client to either view
                        online or download from our secure online platform. We also generate a
                        certificate of destruction for the client.
